# Fire Red Tileset Port Project

This is a direct port of the tilesets from pokemon fire red to emerald designed for the pokemerald decomp. The file structure is designed to make it easy to impliment in to a project.
They are formated for regular emerald but can be converted to a triple layered metatile format in the same way regular pokeemerald is.

## How to install

1: copy the Data folder to the root of your pokeemerald directory

2: Open the following 3 files from scr/data/tilesets
    Graphics.h
    Headers.h
    Metatiles.h

3: Using the files in the scr/data/tilesets in this directory copy the entire content to the file by the same name in your pokeemerald project.
